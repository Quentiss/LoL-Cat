## LoL!cat
This is a python application that tracks the cursor position and key inputs to create a Bongo Cat window which can be used as an overlay for streaming/recording applications.
## [Latest version](https://github.com/Quentiss/LoL-cat/releases)
* Window is now resizable (thanks JapanPanda)
* Dragging the window should no longer be buggy
* Added an option for chroma key green background
* More performance fixes (thanks JapanPanda)
## Changing the cat images
It is entirely possible to edit the png files to make the cat look different (totally understandable, they look bad). However, when doing so you need to make sure that the new picture files have a color depth of 32 bits. Otherwise the program will not work. One way of doing this is by just re-saving the images in a program like paint.net and select the [32-bit color depth option](http://puu.sh/ByjvT/8023ae8252.png). I plan on fixing this bug in the future
